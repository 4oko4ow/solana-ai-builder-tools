# Phantom MCP (Docs Access)

**What it is:** An MCP server/endpoint that allows AI coding assistants (Cursor, Claude, VS Code, etc.) to search and retrieve Phantom developer documentation.

## Why it matters
- Helps your AI assistant answer Phantom integration questions with up-to-date docs
- Reduces hallucinations during implementation

## Example config (Cursor)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "phantom-docs": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://docs.phantom.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
