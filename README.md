# Solana AI Builder Tools

A curated collection of AI-assisted workflows, structured prompts, 
and MCP integrations for building on Solana.

Focused on practical acceleration.

## Repository Structure

- `/workflows` — AI prompt templates for development tasks
- `/mcp` — Model Context Protocol servers relevant to Solana builders
- `/architecture` — on-chain design and product patterns
- `/security` — review checklists and validation prompts

---

## What is Included

- Smart contract scaffolding prompts (Anchor)
- Test generation templates
- Security review checklists
- Transaction simulation workflows
- Devnet deployment checklists
- RPC debugging helpers
- On-chain architecture guidance
- Game & token economy design prompts
- MCP integrations

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to the relevant folder (e.g. `/workflows` or `/mcp`)
2. Copy the structured prompt template
3. Adapt it to your context
4. Review and validate the output manually

AI accelerates — it does not replace understanding.

## MCP Servers

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers allow AI agents 
to access structured documentation and tooling.

- **Solana Official MCP** — official documentation access  
  https://mcp.solana.com/

- **Phantom MCP (Wallet Actions)** — agent-based wallet operations

- **Phantom MCP (Docs Access)** — AI search over Phantom developer documentation

See `/mcp` for details.

## Why This Exists

Solana development is powerful but complex.

This repository systematizes AI-assisted workflows
that help developers:

- Ship faster
- Reduce repetitive boilerplate
- Improve architectural clarity
- Catch issues earlier
