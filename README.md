# Solana AI Builder Tools

A curated collection of AI-assisted workflows, structured prompts, 
and development helpers for building on Solana.

This repository focuses on practical usage and real-world development acceleration.

---

## What is inside

- Smart contract scaffolding prompts (Anchor)
- Test generation templates
- Security review checklists
- Transaction simulation workflows
- Devnet deployment checklists
- RPC debugging helpers
- On-chain architecture guidance
- Game & token economy design prompts

## Why this exists

Building on Solana is powerful but complex.

AI can significantly reduce friction when used correctly.

This repository systematizes structured workflows 
that help developers:

- Ship faster
- Reduce boilerplate
- Catch mistakes earlier
- Think more clearly about architecture

---

## How to use

Each section contains:

- A clear task description
- A structured AI prompt template
- Expected output format
- Notes and caveats

These workflows are meant to assist development,
not replace understanding of Solana fundamentals.

---

## Philosophy

AI is an acceleration layer.

Used properly, it increases leverage.
Used blindly, it increases bugs.

This repository aims to promote structured, responsible AI usage
in Solana development.
